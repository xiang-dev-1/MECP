name: New Code Proposal
about: Propose a new MECP code for the code table
title: "[CODE] "
labels: code-proposal
assignees: ''
---

## Proposed Code
- **Code:** (e.g., M16)
- **Category:** (e.g., M — Medical)
- **English text:** (e.g., "Heat stroke")

## Rationale
Why is this code needed? What scenario does it cover that existing codes cannot?

## Existing Alternatives
Have you considered expressing this with existing codes + freetext? Why is a dedicated code better?

## Category Justification
Why does this code belong in the proposed category rather than another?

## Example Usage
```
MECP/1/M16 P05 48.6520,20.1305
```

## Notes
Any additional context, references to emergency protocols, or real-world scenarios.

*Remember: MECP codes are permanent. A code once assigned never changes meaning. New codes may only be appended, never renumbered or redefined.*
